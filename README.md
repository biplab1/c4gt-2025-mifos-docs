# C4GT 2025 – Project Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes my contributions during the C4GT 2025 program under the Mifos Initiative.  
I worked on two main projects:  
- **Android Client (openmf/android-client)** – Migrating feature modules to **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)**.  
- **Mobile Wallet / Mifos Pay (openmf/mobile-wallet)** – Implementing **UPI payment flows** and setting up future modules (e.g., AutoPay, Bank Transfers, Customer/ Merchant Payments).

---

## 1. Android Client (openmf/android-client)

### Scope
- Migrated feature modules to **Compose Multiplatform**:
  - `feature/checker-inbox-task`
  - `feature/path-tracking`
  - `feature/client` (largest module, 13 sub-features)
- Bug fixing and improvements in sub-features (`client-identifiers`, `client-charges`, `client-pinpoint`, etc.).
- Reviewed multiple PRs from the team.

### Key Achievements
- **Full migration** of `feature/client` to CMP (merged).
- **Bug fixes** across sub-features: dialogs, UI states, silent failures, signature reset, charge dialog UX.
- **Abstractions & design ideas** for Android SDK dependencies (LocationManager, File, Uri, Context).
- **PR reviews** across the repo, helping maintain code quality.

### Selected Pull Requests
- [#2389](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2389) – Migrate checker-inbox-task to CMP  
- [#2400](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2400) – Migrate path-tracking to CMP  
- [#2401](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2401) – Migrate client module to CMP  
- [#2415](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2415) – Fix identifiers empty state & dialog layout  
- [#2430](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2430) – Merge ViewModels, add charge validation  
- [#2433](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/pull/2433) – Fix Client Pinpoint & implement Pinpoint Map dialog  

_(More PRs linked in weekly updates)_  

### Learnings
- Large-scale CMP migrations (navigation, DI, tightly-coupled Android SDK APIs).  
- Debugging CMP-related UI bugs and state issues.  
- Collaboration via reviews, navigation design, and Jira ticketing.

  - Fixed loading issues and added fallbacks for missing API data.  
- **Upgrades & Setup**:
  - Upgraded compileSdk, AGP, Gradle, and dependencies.  
  - Drafted implementation plan for **Merchant Payments KMP Module**.  

### Key Achievements
- Built **frontend flows** for UPI: navigation, screen layouts, and UI/UX fixes.  
- Implemented **QR-based UPI app invocation** (draft PR).
